# Spendings-Tracker
This repository holds the code for my spendings tracker app built with Java and React.js


## TODO
- navbar

    - Only allow money amount inputs when editing or adding spendings
    - Need input cleansing and validation when editing or adding spendings
    - Need max cap on both amount and category
    - When adding or editing a spending and someone puts duplicate categories, collect them to be together (likely to be done on the backend)
- add suspense and error boundary 
- dashboard
- home page
- breadcrumbs (?)
- add ability to create an account w/ code that sends to person's email
- reset password
- export spendings to csv
- popup on errors

## Known issues
