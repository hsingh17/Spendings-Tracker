# Spendings-Tracker

This repository holds the code for my spendings tracker app built with Java and React.js

## TODO
- dashboard -> graphs
- mobile view enhancements for graphs
- zoom in/out in line charts
- home page -> cool parallax effect
- make custom logo
- Use CF dist. for spending category images (maybe, need to consider how to keep images private)
- update ERD -> export from dbeaver
- add junit tests for controller, service, repo
  - user and spendings
- regenerate javadocs
- test from scratch
- create aws architecture and deploy
