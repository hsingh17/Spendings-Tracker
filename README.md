# Spendings-Tracker

This repository holds the code for my spendings tracker app built with Java and React.js

## TODO
- register account screens
- clean up backend to use lombok instead of explicit getters and setters
- add password requirements and form validations for login, send password reset email, password reset, and create account pages
- clean up add/edit spending UI
- google oauth2 login (using cognito?) -> maybe need separate table to store oauth tokens (idk why u would need to but maybe?) -> will need to check to see if user is already created in APP.USER
- remove group by for bar and pie charts
- dashboard -> graphs
- home page -> cool parallax effect
- update ERD -> export from dbeaver
- regenerate javadocs
  - add junit tests for repo layer at minimum
- add empty state and error states everywhere
- add fontawesome icons to relevant areas (signin button, username/password icons)
- test from scratch
