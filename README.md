# Spendings-Tracker

This repository holds the code for my spendings tracker app built with Java and React.js

## TODO

- settings

  - preferred currency type -> list and save spendings page will need to return the preferred currency types so UI can render correctly
  - delete account functionality -> in reality, we're going to simply set IS_ACTIVE to N

- maybe add a notes/memo field when adding spendings (would need to remove the unique category constraint)

- dashboard -> graphs
- zoom in/out in line charts

- home page -> cool parallax effect
- dark/light mode
- make custom logo
- regenerate javadocs
- update ERD -> export from dbeaver
  - add junit tests for repo layer at minimum
- test from scratch
- add sitemap stuff https://stackoverflow.com/a/62976735

## Known issues

- google sign in button randomly resizes
