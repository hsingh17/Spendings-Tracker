# Spendings-Tracker
This repository holds the code for my spendings tracker app built with Java and Next.js


## TODO
- Need to do checking to see if a user is logged in. If they are, then redirect away from the login page. May require a new backend route
- Filtering by date on frontend
- Adding new spendings for the day on frontend
- Edit old spendings
- Charts on dashboard
- Backend need to figure out a way to have a single encryption key instead of it getting a new one every server restart
