# Spendings-Tracker

This repository holds the code for my spendings tracker app built with Java and React.js

## TODO

- settings

  - preferred currency type -> list and save spendings page will need to return the preferred currency types so UI can render correctly

- maybe add a notes/memo field when adding spendings (would need to remove the unique category constraint)
- make navbar items smaller by a little
- dashboard -> graphs
- zoom in/out in line charts

- home page -> cool parallax effect
- dark/light mode
- make custom logo
- regenerate javadocs
- update ERD -> export from dbeaver
- add junit tests for controller, service, repo
  - user and spendings
- test from scratch
- add sitemap stuff https://stackoverflow.com/a/62976735

## Known issues

- the username input on login has funky looking error state
- the eyeball has problems when there it's in an error state
- google sign in button randomly resizes
